Latent Structure Random Graphs
==============================

A capstone project for APMA 1860 Graphs and Networks, Fall 2016.
By: Charlie Windolf. Advisor: Prof. Matthew Harrison.


What's Here
-----------

 - Useful graph and PGF functions in `src/lib/`
 - LaTeX and Python3 source for building the capstone PDF

To Build
--------

Run:

    make all

It needs Python 3 and PDFLaTeX, and the figures will take a while!
Just to make the figures or see if the code is working, run:

    make figure

See the `Makefile` for detail.
